# Blog App project

The Blog app is a simple web application built using Django framework that allows users to create and publish blog posts. The application also includes a commenting system where users can leave comments on blog posts.

The main features of the Blog app include:

Create, edit, and delete blog posts: Users can create new blog posts, edit existing ones, and delete posts they no longer want to have on their blog.
Commenting system: Users can leave comments on blog posts, which are displayed below the post. They can also edit or delete their own comments if they need to.
Responsive design: The application is designed to work on different screen sizes, including desktop and mobile devices.


## Usage
Once you have the application running, you can create a new blog post by clicking on the "Add Post" button on the home page. You can then enter a title and content for the post and click on the "Publish" button to publish the post.

To view a post, click on the post title on the home page. You can view and leave comments on the post on the post detail page.
